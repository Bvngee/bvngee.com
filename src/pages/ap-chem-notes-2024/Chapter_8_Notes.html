<p><strong>Chapter 8 Notes</strong> (Bonding - General Concepts)</p>
<p><strong>Bond energy</strong>: the energy required to break a
bond.</p>
<p>The energy of interaction between a pair of ions can be calculated
using <strong>Coulomb&#39;s Law</strong>, in the form: E = (2.31 * 10^-19
J*nm) * (Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>/r), where r is the distance between
the ion centers in nanometers, and Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> are
the numerical ion charges. It can also be used to calculate the
repulsive energy when two like-charged ions are brought together.</p>
<p>The distance between two atoms where energy is minimal is called the
<strong>Bond Length</strong>.</p>
<p>Electrons shared between identical atoms = covalent bond. Electrons
transferred to form two ions = ionic bond. But in the middle are cases
where not-so-different atoms share electrons unequally, which are
<strong>polar covalent</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>. For example, H-F
.</p>
<p><strong>Electronegativity</strong>: The ability of an atom in a
molecule to attract shared electrons to itself.</p>
<p>Considering a hypothetical molecule, HX, the relative
electronegativity of the two atoms (H and X) is calculated by comparing
their measured bond energy with their “expected” bond energy (expected
is found by H-H bond energy + X-X bond energy / 2).</p>
<p>Δ = (H-X)<sub>act</sub> - (H-X)<sub>exp</sub> . If H and X have
identical electronegativities, the actual and expected bond energies
will be the same and thus Δ = 0. But if X has a greater
electronegativity than H, electrons will spend more time around the X
atom, so it will have a slightly negative charge (thus Δ will not = 0).
(such a bond can be viewed as ionic and covalent.) The attraction
between the partially and oppositely charged atoms leads to a greater
bond strength, so (H-X)<sub>act</sub> will be the greater value.</p>
<p>A molecule (such as HF) that has a center of positive charge and a
center of negative charge is said to be <strong>dipolar</strong>, or to
have a <strong>dipole moment</strong>.</p>
<p>Some molecules have polar bonds but do not have a dipole moment; this
happens because its bond polarities are aligned in such a way that they
cancel each other out (for example, in CO2, as both O atoms are on
opposite sides of the C atom).</p>
<p><strong>lattice energy</strong>: the change in energy that takes
place when separated gaseous ions are packed together to form an ionic
solid. This indicates how strongly the two ions attract each other in an
ionic compound in the solid state. Often referred to as <em>the amount
of energy released when an ionic solid forms from its ions</em>. As this
process is exothermic, the sign of lattice energy is negative.</p>
<p>Consider a hypothetical in which two ions form an ionic solid:</p>
<p>M<sup>+</sup>(s) + X<sup>-</sup>(g) -&gt; MX(s)</p>
<p>To find the lattice energy, we utilize the fact that energy is a
state function and break the process into steps. Each step corresponds
to some amount of energy, which together can be used to find the lattice
energy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sublimation (taking from solid state to gas state) of M</p></li>
<li><p>Ionization of M (taking away 1 electron to make into</p></li>
<li><p>Formation of X<sup>-</sup> ions from X - corresponds to X’s
electron affinity</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A more complex example might involve the dissociation of diatomic gas
molecules into singular atoms, for example.</p>
<p>Lattice energy can also be represented by a modified form of
Coulomb’s Law,</p>
<p>E = k * (Q<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>/r), where k is a proportionality
constant that depends on the solid’s structure and ions’ electron
configurations, and again Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> are the
charges of the ions. E will have a negative sign with two oppositely
charged ions, as their bonding is exothermic (arrives at a lesser-energy
state).</p>
<p>Since there is really no good way to classify a molecule as having a
strictly ionic or polar bond, the adopted definition for an ionic
compound is: <em>any compound that when melted conducts electricity will
be classified as ionic</em>.</p>
<p>As the number of shared electron pairs in a bond increases, the bond
length shortens.</p>
<p>Bond energies can be used to calculate approximate energies for
reactions. Take, for example, H<sub>2</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> -&gt; 2HF .
This involves breaking two bonds (endothermic), H-H and F-F, and forming
two bonds (exothermic), both H-F . The total enthalpy change of these
processes can be written as <em>ΔH = ∑n * D (bonds broken) - ∑n * D
(bonds formed)</em>, where D represents the bond energy per mole of
bonds (D is <em>always</em> positive), and n represents the moles of a
particular type of bond. In English, the change in enthalpy of the
reaction is the total (absorbed) energy of all bonds broken minus the
total (released) energy of all bonds formed. For our example, <em>ΔH =
D<sub>H-H</sub> + D<sub>F-F</sub> - 2D<sub>H-F</sub></em> .</p>
<p><strong>Localized Electron (LE) Model</strong>: a simple model used
to describe covalent bonds that assumes that <em>a molecule is composed
of atoms that are bound together by sharing pairs of electrons using the
atomic orbitals of the bound atoms</em>. Electron pairs in the molecule
are assumed to be localized on a particular atom OR in the space between
two atoms (their locations are never this simple in real life). Electron
pairs localized on an atom are called <strong>lone pairs</strong>, and
those localized between two atoms are called <strong>bonding
pairs</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Lewis structure</strong> of a molecule shows how the
valence electrons are arranged among the atoms in the molecule.</p>
<p>From experiment, chemists have learned that <em>the most important
requirement for the formation of a stable compound is that the atoms
achieve noble gas configurations.</em></p>
<p><strong>Resonance</strong> is invoked when multiple valid Lewis
structures exist for a given molecule AND that molecule has at least one
double bond. It is assumed that the molecule’s correct description is
not given by any of the valid structures but rather a superposition of
all of them. The situation is usually represented by double-headed
arrows between all valid structures.</p>
<p>Since the localized electron model is based on electron pairs, it
does not work with any molecules that have an off number of electrons
(NO, NO<sub>2</sub>) and another model is needed.</p>
<p>The <strong>formal charge</strong> of an atom in a molecule is the
difference between the number of valence electrons on the free atom and
the number of valence electrons assigned to the atom in the molecule. It
represents a prediction of atoms’ charges within the molecule, similar
to oxidation states (but in practice produces better, less exaggerated
results).</p>
<p><em>Atom’s Formal Charge = (# of valence e<sup>-</sup>’s on free
atom) - (# of valence e<sup>-</sup>’s assigned to the atom in the
molecule)</em></p>
<p>To do so, we assign the valence electrons in the molecule to the
various atoms making the following assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lone pair electrons belong entirely to the atom in
question</p></li>
<li><p>Shared electrons are divided equally between the two sharing
atoms</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Atoms’ formal charges in molecules are useful as we can make the
following two fundamental assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Atoms in molecules try to have formal charges as close to 0 as
possible</p></li>
<li><p>Any negative formal charges are expected to reside on the most
electronegative atoms</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Valence Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model</strong>:
A model used to predict approximate molecular structure by minimizing
electron-pair repulsion.</p>
<p>Steps to apply:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule</p></li>
<li><p>Count the electron pairs and arrange them in the way that
minimizes repulsion</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the positions of the atoms from the <em>way the
electron pairs are shared</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the name of the molecular structure from the
<em>positions of the atoms</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Important: the exact structure type is determined by the placement of
<u>electron pairs</u>, but the actual structure name is determined only
by the positions of the <u>atoms</u>.</p>
<p>Important general rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the VSEPR model, multiple bonds (double, triple bonds etc)
count as one effective electron pair.</p></li>
<li><p>For molecules with resonance (multiple valid Lewis structures),
any one of the Lewis structures can be used to predict the molecular
structure using the VSEPR model.</p></li>
</ul>
